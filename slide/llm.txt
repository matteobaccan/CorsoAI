this video is going to give you everything you need to go from knowing absolutely nothing about artificial intelligence and large language models to having a solid foundation of how these revolutionary Technologies work over the past year artificial intelligence has completely changed the world with products like chat PT potentially appending every single industry and how people interact with technology in general and in this video I will be focusing on llms how they work ethical cons iterations applications and so much more and this video was created in collaboration with an incredible program called AI camp in which high school students learn all about artificial intelligence and I'll talk more about that later in the video let's go so first what is an llm is it different from Ai and how is chat GPT related to all of this llms stand for large language models which is a type of neural network that's trained on massive amounts of text data it's generally trained on data that can be found online everything from web scraping to books to transcripts anything that is text based can be trained into a large language model and taking a step back what is a neural network a neural network is essentially a series of algorithms that try to recognize patterns in data and really what they're trying to do is simulate how the human brain works and llms are a specific type of neural network that focus on understanding natural language and as mentioned llms learn by reading tons of books articles internet texts and there's really no limitation there and so how do llms differ from traditional programming well with traditional programming it's instruction based which means if x then why you're explicitly telling the computer what to do you're giving it a set of instructions to execute but with llms it's a completely different story you're teaching the computer not how to do things but how to learn how to do things things and this is a much more flexible approach and is really good for a lot of different applications where previously traditional coding could not accomplish them so one example application is image recognition with image recognition traditional programming would require you to hardcode every single rule for how to let's say identify different letters so a b c d but if you're handwriting these letters everybody's handwritten letters look different so how do you use traditional programming to identify every single possible variation well that's where this AI approach comes in instead of giving a computer explicit instructions for how to identify a handwritten letter you instead give it a bunch of examples of what handwritten letters look like and then it can infer what a new handwritten letter looks like based on all of the examples that it has what also sets machine learning and large language models apart and this new approach to programming is that they are much more more flexible much more adaptable meaning they can learn from their mistakes and inaccuracies and are thus so much more scalable than traditional programming llms are incredibly powerful at a wide range of tasks including summarization text generation creative writing question and answer programming and if you've watched any of my videos you know how powerful these large language models can be and they're only getting better know that right now large language models and a in general are the worst they'll ever be and as we're generating more data on the internet and as we use synthetic data which means data created by other large language models these models are going to get better rapidly and it's super exciting to think about what the future holds now let's talk a little bit about the history and evolution of large language models we're going to cover just a few of the large language models today in this section the history of llms traces all the way back to the Eliza model which was from 1966 which was really the first first language model it had pre-programmed answers based on keywords it had a very limited understanding of the English language and like many early language models you started to see holes in its logic after a few back and forth in a conversation and then after that language models really didn't evolve for a very long time although technically the first recurrent neural network was created in 1924 or RNN they weren't really able to learn until 1972 and these new learning language models are a series of neural networks with layers and weights and a whole bunch of stuff that I'm not going to get into in this video and rnns were really the first technology that was able to predict the next word in a sentence rather than having everything pre-programmed for it and that was really the basis for how current large language models work and even after this and the Advent of deep learning in the early 2000s the field of AI evolved very slowly with language models far behind what we see today this all changed in 2017 where the Google Deep Mind team released a research paper about a new technology called Transformers and this paper was called attention is all you need and a quick side note I don't think Google even knew quite what they had published at that time but that same paper is what led open AI to develop chat GPT so obviously other computer scientists saw the potential for the Transformers architecture with this new Transformers architecture it was far more advanced it required decreased training time and it had many other features like self attention which I'll cover later in this video Transformers allowed for pre-trained large language models like gpt1 which was developed by open AI in 2018 it had 117 million parameters and it was completely revolutionary but soon to be outclassed by other llms then after that Bert was released beert in 2018 that had 340 million parameters and had bir directionality which means it had the ability to process text in both directions which helped it have a better understanding of context and as comparison a unidirectional model only has an understanding of the words that came before the target text and after this llms didn't develop a lot of new technology but they did increase greatly in scale gpt2 was released in early 2019 and had 2.5 billion parameters then GPT 3 in June of 2020 with 175 billion paramet and it was at this point that the public started noticing large language models GPT had a much better understanding of natural language than any of its predecessors and this is the type of model that powers chat GPT which is probably the model that you're most familiar with and chat GPT became so popular because it was so much more accurate than anything anyone had ever seen before and it was really because of its size and because it was now built into this chatbot format anybody could jump in and really understand how to interact act with this model Chad GPT 3.5 came out in December of 2022 and started this current wave of AI that we see today then in March 2023 GPT 4 was released and it was incredible and still is incredible to this day it had a whopping reported 1.76 trillion parameters and uses likely a mixture of experts approach which means it has multiple models that are all fine-tuned for specific use cases and then when somebody asks a question to it it chooses which of those models to use and then they added multimodality and a bunch of other features and that brings us to where we are today all right now let's talk about how llms actually work in a little bit more detail the process of how large language models work can be split into three steps the first of these steps is called tokenization and there are neural networks that are trained to split long text into individual tokens and a token is essentially about 34s of a word so if it's a shorter word like high or that or there it's probably just one token but if you have a longer word like summarization it's going to be split into multiple pieces and the way that tokenization happens is actually different for every model some of them separate prefixes and suffixes let's look at an example what is the tallest building so what is the tallest building are all separate tokens and so that separates the suffix off of tallest but not building because it is taking the context into account and this step is done so models can understand each word individually just like humans we understand each word individually and as groupings of words and then the second step of llms is something called embeddings the large language models turns those tokens into embedding vectors turning those tokens into essentially a bunch of numerical representations of those tokens numbers and this makes it significantly easier for the computer to read and understand each word and how the different words relate to each other and these numbers all correspond with the position in an embeddings Vector database and then the final step in the process is Transformers which we'll get to in a little bit but first let's talk about Vector databases and I'm going to use the terms word and token interchangeably so just keep that in mind because they're almost the same thing not quite but almost and so these word embeddings that I've been talking about are placed into something called a vector database these databases are storage and retrieval mechanisms that are highly optimized for vectors and again those are just numbers long series of numbers because they're converted into these vectors they can easily see which words are related to other words based on how similar they are how close they are based on their embeddings and that is how the large language model is able to predict the next word based on the previous words Vector databases capture the relationship between data as vectors in multidimensional space I know that sounds complicated but it's really just a lot of numbers vectors are objects with a magnitude and a direction which both influence how similar one vector is to another and that is how llms represent words based on those numbers each word gets turned into a vector capturing semantic meaning and its relationship to other words so here's an example the words book and worm which independently might not look like they're related to each other but they are related Concepts because they frequently appear together a bookworm somebody who likes to read a lot and because of that they will have embeddings that look close to each other and so models build up an understanding of natural language using these embeddings and looking for similarity of different words terms groupings of words and all of these nuanced relationships and the vector format helps models understand natural language better than other formats and you can kind of think of all this like a map if you have a map with two landmarks that are close to each other they're likely going to have very similar coordinates so it's kind of like that okay now let's talk about Transformers mat Matrix representations can be made out of those vectors that we were just talking about this is done by extracting some information out of the numbers and placing all of the information into a matrix through an algorithm called multihead attention the output of the multi-head attention algorithm is a set of numbers which tells the model how much the words and its order are contributing to the sentence as a whole we transform the input Matrix into an output Matrix which will then correspond with a word having the same values as that output Matrix so basically we're taking that input Matrix converting it into an output Matrix and then converting it into natural language and the word is the final output of this whole process this transformation is done by the algorithm that was created during the training process so the model's understanding of how to do this transformation is based on all of its knowledge that it was trained with all of that text Data from the internet from books from articles Etc and it learned which sequences of of words go together and their corresponding next words based on the weights determined during training Transformers use an attention mechanism to understand the context of words within a sentence it involves calculations with the dot product which is essentially a number representing how much the word contributed to the sentence it will find the difference between the dot products of words and give it correspondingly large values for attention and it will take that word into account more if it has higher attention now now let's talk about how large language models actually get trained the first step of training a large language model is collecting the data you need a lot of data when I say billions of parameters that is just a measure of how much data is actually going into training these models and you need to find a really good data set if you have really bad data going into a model then you're going to have a really bad model garbage in garbage out so if a data set is incomplete or biased the large language model will be also and data sets are huge we're talking about massive massive amounts of data they take data in from web pages from books from conversations from Reddit posts from xposts from YouTube transcriptions basically anywhere where we can get some Text data that data is becoming so valuable let me put into context how massive the data sets we're talking about really are so here's a little bit of text which is 276 tokens that's it now if we zoom out that one pixel is that many tokens and now here's a representation of 285 million tokens which is 0.02% of the 1.3 trillion tokens that some large language models take to train and there's an entire science behind data pre-processing which prepares the data to be used to train a model everything from looking at the data quality to labeling consistency data cleaning data transformation and data reduction but I'm not going to go too deep into that and this pre-processing can take a long time and it depends on the type of machine being used how much processing power you have the size of the data set the number of pre-processing steps and a whole bunch of other factors that make it really difficult to know exactly how long pre-processing is going to take but one thing that we know takes a long time is the actual training companies like Nvidia are building Hardware specifically tailored for the math behind large language models and this Hardware is constantly getting better the software used to process these models are getting better also and so the total time to process models is decreasing but the size of the models is increasing and to train these models it is extremely expensive because you need a lot of processing power electricity and these chips are not cheap and that is why Nvidia stock price has skyrocketed their revenue growth has been extraordinary and so with the process of training we take this pre-processed text data that we talked about earlier and it's fed into the model and then using Transformers or whatever technology a model is actually based on but most likely Transformers it will try to predict the next word based on the context of that data and it's going to adjust the weights of the model to get the best possible output and this process repeats millions and millions of times over and over again until we reach some optimal quality and then the final step is evaluation a small amount of the data is set aside for evaluation and the model is tested on this data set for performance and then the model is is adjusted if necessary the metric used to determine the effectiveness of the model is called perplexity it will compare two words based on their similarity and it will give a good score if the words are related and a bad score if it's not and then we also use rlf reinforcement learning through human feedback and that's when users or testers actually test the model and provide positive or negative scores based on the output and then once again the model is adjusted as necessary all right let's talk about fine-tuning now which I think a lot of you are going to be interested in because it's something that the average person can get into quite easily so we have these popular large language models that are trained on massive sets of data to build general language capabilities and these pre-trained models like Bert like GPT give developers a head start versus training models from scratch but then in comes fine-tuning which allows us to take these raw models these Foundation models and fine-tune them for our specific specific use cases so let's think about an example let's say you want to fine tuna model to be able to take pizza orders to be able to have conversations answer questions about pizza and finally be able to allow customers to buy pizza you can take a pre-existing set of conversations that exemplify the back and forth between a pizza shop and a customer load that in fine- tune a model and then all of a sudden that model is going to be much better at having conversations about pizza ordering the model updates the weights to be better at understanding certain Pizza terminology questions responses tone everything and fine-tuning is much faster than a full training and it produces much higher accuracy and fine-tuning allows pre-trained models to be fine-tuned for real world use cases and finally you can take a single foundational model and fine-tune it any number of times for any number of use cases and there are a lot of great Services out there that allow you to do that and again it's all about the quality of your data so if you have a really good data set that you're going to f- tune a model on the model is going to be really really good and conversely if you have a poor quality data set it's not going to perform as well all right let me pause for a second and talk about AI Camp so as mentioned earlier this video all of its content the animations have been created in collaboration with students from AI Camp AI Camp is a learning experience for students that are aged 13 and above you work in small personalized groups with experienced mentors you work together to create an AI product using NLP computer vision and data science AI Camp has both a 3-week and a onewe program during summer that requires zero programming experience and they also have a new program which is 10 weeks long during the school year which is less intensive than the onewe and 3-we programs for those students who are really busy AI Camp's mission is to provide students with deep knowledge and artificial intelligence which will position them to be ready for a in the real world I'll link an article from USA Today in the description all about AI camp but if you're a student or if you're a parent of a student within this age I would highly recommend checking out AI Camp go to ai- camp.org to learn more now let's talk about limitations and challenges of large language models as capable as llms are they still have a lot of limitations recent models continue to get better but they are still flawed they're incredibly valuable and knowledgeable in certain ways but they're also deeply flawed in others like math and logic and reasoning they still struggle a lot of the time versus humans which understand Concepts like that pretty easily also bias and safety continue to be a big problem large language models are trained on data created by humans which is naturally flawed humans have opinions on everything and those opinions trickle down into these models these data sets may include harmful or biased information and some companies take their models a step further and provide a level of censorship to those models and that's an entire discussion in itself whether censorship is worthwhile or not I know a lot of you already know my opinions on this from my previous videos and another big limitation of llms historically has been that they only have knowledge up into the point where their training occurred but that is starting to be solved with chat GPT being able to browse the web for example Gro from x. aai being able to access live tweets but there's still a lot of Kinks to be worked out with this also another another big challenge for large language modelss is hallucinations which means that they sometimes just make things up or get things patently wrong and they will be so confident in being wrong too they will state things with the utmost confidence but will be completely wrong look at this example how many letters are in the string and then we give it a random string of characters and then the answer is the string has 16 letters even though it only has 15 letters another problem is that large language models are EXT extremely Hardware intensive they cost a ton to train and to fine-tune because it takes so much processing power to do that and there's a lot of Ethics to consider too a lot of AI companies say they aren't training their models on copyrighted material but that has been found to be false currently there are a ton of lawsuits going through the courts about this issue next let's talk about the real world applications of large language models why are they so valuable why are they so talked about about and why are they transforming the world right in front of our eyes large language models can be used for a wide variety of tasks not just chatbots they can be used for language translation they can be used for coding they can be used as programming assistants they can be used for summarization question answering essay writing translation and even image and video creation basically any type of thought problem that a human can do with a computer large language models can likely also do if not today pretty soon in the future now let's talk about current advancements and research currently there's a lot of talk about knowledge distillation which basically means transferring key Knowledge from very large Cutting Edge models to smaller more efficient models think about it like a professor condensing Decades of experience in a textbook down to something that the students can comprehend and this allows smaller language models to benefit from the knowledge gained from these large language models but still run highly efficiently on everyday consumer hardware and and it makes large language models more accessible and practical to run even on cell phones or other end devices there's also been a lot of research and emphasis on rag which is retrieval augmented generation which basically means you're giving large language models the ability to look up information outside of the data that it was trained on you're using Vector databases the same way that large language models are trained but you're able to store massive amounts of additional data that can be queried by that large language model now let's talk about the ethical considerations and there's a lot to think about here and I'm just touching on some of the major topics first we already talked about that the models are trained on potentially copyrighted material and if that's the case is that fair use probably not next these models can and will be used for harmful acts there's no avoiding it large language models can be used to scam other people to create massive misinformation and disinformation campaigns including fake images fake text fake opinions and almost definitely the entire White Collar Workforce is going to be disrupted by large language models as I mentioned anything anybody can do in front of a computer is probably something that the AI can also do so lawyers writers programmers there are so many different professions that are going to be completely disrupted by artificial intelligence and then finally AGI what happens when AI becomes so smart and maybe even starts thinking for itself this is where we have to have something called alignment which means the AI is aligned to the same incentives and outcomes as humans so last let's talk about what's happening on The Cutting Edge and in the immediate future there are a number of ways large language models can be improved first they can fact check themselves with information gathered from the web but obviously you can see the inherent flaws in that then we also touched on mixture of experts which is an incredible new technology which allows multiple models to kind of be merged together all fine tune to be experts in certain domains and then when the actual prompt comes through it chooses which of those experts to use so these are huge models that actually run really really efficiently and then there's a lot of work on multimodality so taking input from voice from images from video every possible input source and having a single output from that there's also a lot of work being done to improve reasoning ability having models think slowly is a new trend that I've been seeing in papers like orca too which basically just forces a large language model to think about problems step by step rather than trying to jump to the final conclusion immediately and then also larger context sizes if you want a large language model to process a huge amount of data it has to have a very large context window and a context window is just how much information you can give to a prompt to get the output and one way to achieve that is by giving large language models memory with projects like mgpt which I did a video on and I'll drop that in the description below and that just means giving models external memory from that core data set that they were trained on so that's it for today if you liked this video please consider giving a like And subscribe check out AI Camp I'll drop all the information in the description below and of course check out any of my other AI videos if you want to learn even more I'll see you in the next one

00:00:00.160 this video is going to give you
00:00:01.599 everything you need to go from knowing
00:00:03.560 absolutely nothing about artificial
00:00:05.720 intelligence and large language models
00:00:07.640 to having a solid foundation of how
00:00:10.360 these revolutionary Technologies work
00:00:12.799 over the past year artificial
00:00:14.320 intelligence has completely changed the
00:00:16.239 world with products like chat PT
00:00:18.880 potentially appending every single
00:00:20.680 industry and how people interact with
00:00:23.160 technology in general and in this video
00:00:25.599 I will be focusing on llms how they work
00:00:29.240 ethical cons iterations applications and
00:00:32.119 so much more and this video was created
00:00:34.360 in collaboration with an incredible
00:00:36.680 program called AI camp in which high
00:00:39.040 school students learn all about
00:00:40.760 artificial intelligence and I'll talk
00:00:42.840 more about that later in the video let's
00:00:44.960 go so first what is an llm is it
00:00:48.239 different from Ai and how is chat GPT
00:00:50.960 related to all of this llms stand for
00:00:54.039 large language models which is a type of
00:00:56.239 neural network that's trained on massive
00:00:58.600 amounts of text data it's generally
00:01:01.199 trained on data that can be found online
00:01:04.040 everything from web scraping to books to
00:01:06.360 transcripts anything that is text based
00:01:08.960 can be trained into a large language
00:01:10.799 model and taking a step back what is a
00:01:13.000 neural network a neural network is
00:01:15.080 essentially a series of algorithms that
00:01:17.280 try to recognize patterns in data and
00:01:20.200 really what they're trying to do is
00:01:21.640 simulate how the human brain works and
00:01:23.880 llms are a specific type of neural
00:01:26.000 network that focus on understanding
00:01:28.400 natural language and as mentioned llms
00:01:31.159 learn by reading tons of books articles
00:01:34.119 internet texts and there's really no
00:01:36.159 limitation there and so how do llms
00:01:38.840 differ from traditional programming well
00:01:41.280 with traditional programming it's
00:01:43.280 instruction based which means if x then
00:01:46.600 why you're explicitly telling the
00:01:48.680 computer what to do you're giving it a
00:01:50.680 set of instructions to execute but with
00:01:53.320 llms it's a completely different story
00:01:55.880 you're teaching the computer not how to
00:01:57.520 do things but how to learn how to do



Questo video ti fornirà tutto ciò di cui hai bisogno per passare dall’assoluta ignoranza riguardo all’intelligenza artificiale e ai grandi modelli di linguaggio, fino a ottenere una solida base su come funzionano queste rivoluzionarie tecnologie. Nel corso dell’ultimo anno, l’intelligenza artificiale ha completamente cambiato il mondo, con prodotti come Chat PT che potenzialmente influenzano ogni singola industria e il modo in cui le persone interagiscono con la tecnologia in generale. In questo video mi concentrerò sugli LLM (Large Language Models), su come funzionano, le loro implicazioni etiche, le iterazioni e molto altro. Questo video è stato creato in collaborazione con un incredibile programma chiamato AI Camp, in cui gli studenti delle scuole superiori imparano tutto sull’intelligenza artificiale. Ne parlerò di più più avanti nel video. Iniziamo!

Cosa sono gli LLM? Sono modelli di linguaggio di grandi dimensioni, che rappresentano un tipo di rete neurale addestrata su enormi quantità di dati testuali. Questi modelli vengono generalmente addestrati su dati reperibili online, che spaziano dal web scraping ai libri e alle trascrizioni. Qualsiasi cosa basata su testo può essere utilizzata per addestrare un grande modello di linguaggio. Ma cos’è una rete neurale? Essenzialmente, è una serie di algoritmi che cercano di riconoscere schemi nei dati, simulando il funzionamento del cervello umano. Gli LLM sono un tipo specifico di rete neurale focalizzato sulla comprensione del linguaggio naturale. Come accennato, gli LLM imparano leggendo tonnellate di libri, articoli e testi presenti su Internet, senza limitazioni particolari.

E ora, qual è la differenza tra gli LLM e la programmazione tradizionale? Con la programmazione tradizionale, si basa su istruzioni specifiche: “se X, allora Y”. In altre parole, si dice esplicitamente al computer cosa fare, fornendo un insieme di istruzioni da eseguire. Con gli LLM, invece, si insegna al computer come imparare a fare le cose, piuttosto che fornirgli istruzioni dirette. Questo approccio è molto più flessibile e aperto alle possibilità.



00:01:59.640 things things and this is a much more
00:02:01.560 flexible approach and is really good for
00:02:04.360 a lot of different applications where
00:02:06.759 previously traditional coding could not
00:02:09.440 accomplish them so one example
00:02:11.280 application is image recognition with
00:02:13.800 image recognition traditional
00:02:15.560 programming would require you to
00:02:17.720 hardcode every single rule for how to
00:02:21.280 let's say identify different letters so
00:02:24.360 a b c d but if you're handwriting these
00:02:27.519 letters everybody's handwritten letters
00:02:29.239 look different so how do you use
00:02:30.800 traditional programming to identify
00:02:33.120 every single possible variation well
00:02:35.319 that's where this AI approach comes in
00:02:37.560 instead of giving a computer explicit
00:02:39.280 instructions for how to identify a
00:02:41.400 handwritten letter you instead give it a
00:02:43.800 bunch of examples of what handwritten
00:02:46.080 letters look like and then it can infer
00:02:48.640 what a new handwritten letter looks like
00:02:50.800 based on all of the examples that it has
00:02:53.360 what also sets machine learning and
00:02:55.080 large language models apart and this new
00:02:56.840 approach to programming is that they are
00:02:59.280 much more more flexible much more
00:03:01.200 adaptable meaning they can learn from
00:03:03.239 their mistakes and inaccuracies and are
00:03:05.360 thus so much more scalable than
00:03:07.920 traditional programming llms are
00:03:10.080 incredibly powerful at a wide range of
00:03:12.920 tasks including summarization text
00:03:15.319 generation creative writing question and
00:03:17.920 answer programming and if you've watched
00:03:20.560 any of my videos you know how powerful

Questo approccio più flessibile è davvero vantaggioso per molte applicazioni diverse, in cui la programmazione tradizionale non sarebbe in grado di raggiungere gli stessi risultati. Un esempio di applicazione è il riconoscimento delle immagini.

Nel riconoscimento delle immagini, la programmazione tradizionale richiederebbe di codificare manualmente ogni singola regola per identificare, ad esempio, le diverse lettere dell’alfabeto. Tuttavia, quando si tratta di lettere scritte a mano, ognuna ha una forma unica. Come si può utilizzare la programmazione tradizionale per identificare ogni possibile variante?

Qui entra in gioco l’approccio dell’intelligenza artificiale (AI). Invece di fornire al computer istruzioni esplicite su come identificare una lettera scritta a mano, si forniscono diversi esempi di lettere scritte a mano. Il modello di intelligenza artificiale può quindi inferire come dovrebbe apparire una nuova lettera scritta a mano basandosi su tutti gli esempi a sua disposizione.

Ciò che distingue gli algoritmi di machine learning e i grandi modelli di linguaggio da questa nuova metodologia di programmazione è la loro flessibilità e adattabilità. Possono imparare dai propri errori e inesattezze, rendendoli scalabili rispetto alla programmazione tradizionale.

Gli LLM (Large Language Models) sono incredibilmente potenti in una vasta gamma di compiti, tra cui sintesi, generazione di testi, scrittura creativa, risposte alle domande e programmazione. Se hai visto alcuni dei miei video, sai quanto possano essere efficaci questi grandi modelli di linguaggio, e stanno migliorando costantemente. Attualmente, i modelli di linguaggio sono al loro peggio, ma solo perché stanno continuando a evolvere e migliorare! 🚀


00:03:23.080 these large language models can be and
00:03:25.319 they're only getting better know that
00:03:27.680 right now large language models and a in
00:03:30.120 general are the worst they'll ever be
00:03:32.519 and as we're generating more data on the
00:03:34.480 internet and as we use synthetic data
00:03:36.760 which means data created by other large
00:03:38.680 language models these models are going
00:03:40.799 to get better rapidly and it's super
00:03:43.200 exciting to think about what the future
00:03:44.599 holds now let's talk a little bit about
00:03:46.280 the history and evolution of large
00:03:48.239 language models we're going to cover
00:03:49.799 just a few of the large language models
00:03:51.280 today in this section the history of
00:03:53.120 llms traces all the way back to the
00:03:55.640 Eliza model which was from
00:03:57.760 1966 which was really the first first
00:03:59.920 language model it had pre-programmed
00:04:02.120 answers based on keywords it had a very
00:04:05.000 limited understanding of the English
00:04:06.640 language and like many early language
00:04:09.040 models you started to see holes in its
00:04:10.879 logic after a few back and forth in a
00:04:12.879 conversation and then after that
00:04:14.680 language models really didn't evolve for
00:04:16.720 a very long time although technically
00:04:18.759 the first recurrent neural network was
00:04:20.639 created in 1924 or RNN they weren't
00:04:23.919 really able to learn until 1972 and
00:04:26.600 these new learning language models are a
00:04:28.880 series of neural networks with layers
00:04:31.360 and weights and a whole bunch of stuff
00:04:33.400 that I'm not going to get into in this
00:04:35.080 video and rnns were really the first
00:04:38.039 technology that was able to predict the
00:04:40.320 next word in a sentence rather than
00:04:42.639 having everything pre-programmed for it
00:04:44.919 and that was really the basis for how
00:04:47.000 current large language models work and
00:04:49.080 even after this and the Advent of deep
00:04:51.240 learning in the early 2000s the field of
00:04:53.720 AI evolved very slowly with language
00:04:56.360 models far behind what we see today this
00:04:59.560 all changed in 2017 where the Google
00:05:02.440 Deep Mind team released a research paper
00:05:04.919 about a new technology called
00:05:06.639 Transformers and this paper was called
00:05:09.199 attention is all you need and a quick
00:05:11.840 side note I don't think Google even knew
00:05:13.880 quite what they had published at that
00:05:15.520 time but that same paper is what led
00:05:17.919 open AI to develop chat GPT so obviously
00:05:21.479 other computer scientists saw the
00:05:23.360 potential for the Transformers
00:05:24.960 architecture with this new Transformers
00:05:27.080 architecture it was far more advanced it
00:05:29.560 required decreased training time and it
00:05:31.639 had many other features like self
00:05:33.120 attention which I'll cover later in this
00:05:34.759 video Transformers allowed for
00:05:36.400 pre-trained large language models like
00:05:38.360 gpt1 which was developed by open AI in
00:05:41.360 2018 it had 117 million parameters and
00:05:45.160 it was completely revolutionary but soon
00:05:47.360 to be outclassed by other llms then
00:05:50.240 after that Bert was released beert in
00:05:53.240 2018 that had 340 million parameters and
00:05:57.000 had bir directionality which means it
00:05:59.160 had the ability to process text in both
00:06:01.639 directions which helped it have a better
00:06:04.400 understanding of context and as
00:06:06.720 comparison a unidirectional model only
00:06:09.160 has an understanding of the words that
00:06:10.599 came before the target text and after
00:06:13.479 this llms didn't develop a lot of new

Le grandi modelli di linguaggio possono essere e stanno solo migliorando. Al momento, i modelli di linguaggio di grandi dimensioni, in generale, sono al loro peggio e, man mano che generiamo più dati su Internet e utilizziamo dati sintetici, ovvero dati creati da altri grandi modelli di linguaggio, questi modelli miglioreranno rapidamente. È entusiasmante pensare a cosa ci riserva il futuro. Ora parliamo un po’ della storia e dell’evoluzione dei grandi modelli di linguaggio. In questa sezione, tracceremo la storia dei LLM fino al modello Eliza del 1966, che è stato il primo modello di linguaggio. Aveva risposte pre-programmate basate su parole chiave e una comprensione molto limitata della lingua inglese. Come molti modelli di linguaggio iniziali, si potevano notare lacune nella sua logica dopo qualche scambio di battute in una conversazione. Dopo di ciò, i modelli di linguaggio non hanno subito un’evoluzione per molto tempo. Anche se tecnicamente la prima rete neurale ricorrente (RNN) è stata creata nel 1924, non sono stati in grado di apprendere fino al 1972. Questi nuovi modelli di apprendimento del linguaggio sono una serie di reti neurali con strati, pesi e molte altre componenti che non entrerò nei dettagli in questo video. Le RNN sono state davvero la prima tecnologia in grado di prevedere la parola successiva in una frase, anziché avere tutto pre-programmato.


00:06:16.000 technology but they did increase greatly
00:06:18.560 in scale gpt2 was released in early 2019
00:06:21.880 and had 2.5 billion parameters then GPT
00:06:25.280 3 in June of 2020 with 175 billion
00:06:29.080 paramet
00:06:29.919 and it was at this point that the public
00:06:31.599 started noticing large language models
00:06:33.680 GPT had a much better understanding of
00:06:36.319 natural language than any of its
00:06:38.039 predecessors and this is the type of
00:06:40.199 model that powers chat GPT which is
00:06:42.599 probably the model that you're most
00:06:43.919 familiar with and chat GPT became so
00:06:46.599 popular because it was so much more
00:06:48.479 accurate than anything anyone had ever
00:06:50.319 seen before and it was really because of
00:06:52.400 its size and because it was now built
00:06:54.800 into this chatbot format anybody could
00:06:57.240 jump in and really understand how to
00:06:59.039 interact act with this model Chad GPT
00:07:00.960 3.5 came out in December of 2022 and
00:07:03.759 started this current wave of AI that we
00:07:06.319 see today then in March 2023 GPT 4 was
00:07:09.840 released and it was incredible and still
00:07:12.680 is incredible to this day it had a
00:07:14.960 whopping reported 1.76 trillion
00:07:18.160 parameters and uses likely a mixture of
00:07:21.160 experts approach which means it has
00:07:23.160 multiple models that are all fine-tuned
00:07:25.520 for specific use cases and then when
00:07:27.800 somebody asks a question to it it
00:07:29.759 chooses which of those models to use and
00:07:31.960 then they added multimodality and a
00:07:33.639 bunch of other features and that brings
00:07:35.440 us to where we are today all right now
00:07:37.199 let's talk about how llms actually work
00:07:39.440 in a little bit more detail the process

La tecnologia dei grandi modelli di linguaggio ha fatto passi da gigante. GPT-2, rilasciato all’inizio del 2019, aveva 2,5 miliardi di parametri. Successivamente, GPT-3, lanciato a giugno 2020, ha raggiunto la cifra impressionante di 175 miliardi di parametri1. Questo è il modello che alimenta Chat GPT, probabilmente il modello con cui sei più familiare. La sua popolarità è dovuta alla sua straordinaria accuratezza, superiore a qualsiasi altro modello precedentemente sviluppato. La sua dimensione e la sua integrazione in un formato di chatbot hanno reso l’interazione con esso accessibile a chiunque.

Chat GPT 3.5, rilasciato nel dicembre 2022, ha dato il via all’attuale ondata di intelligenza artificiale che vediamo oggi. Ma la vera stella è GPT-4, lanciato nel marzo 2023. Questo modello incredibile ha 1,76 trilioni di parametri ed è probabilmente basato su un approccio misto di esperti, con più modelli ottimizzati per specifici casi d’uso. Quando qualcuno gli pone una domanda, GPT-4 seleziona il modello più adatto per rispondere. Inoltre, GPT-4 ha introdotto la multimodalità e altre funzionalità avanzate1.

Ma come funzionano davvero questi grandi modelli di linguaggio? Vediamolo in dettaglio:

    Raccolta di dati: I LLMs si nutrono di grandi quantità di testo. Questi dati vengono utilizzati per imparare le relazioni tra parole e frasi.
    Architettura dei modelli: I LLMs sono spesso basati su architetture di trasformatori, come il Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Questi modelli eccellono nel trattare dati sequenziali come l’input testuale.
    Apprendimento tramite trasferimento: I LLMs utilizzano una tecnica chiamata trasferimento di apprendimento. Iniziano con un modello pre-addestrato e lo adattano a un compito specifico. Questo permette loro di apprendere dai dati specifici del compito senza dover essere addestrati da zero23.

In breve, i LLMs sono progettati per comprendere e generare testo come farebbe un essere umano, grazie ai miliardi di parametri che catturano le sfumature del linguaggio e consentono di svolgere una vasta gamma di compiti correlati al linguaggio. Questi modelli stanno rivoluzionando applicazioni in vari campi, dai chatbot agli assistenti virtuali, dalla generazione di contenuti all’assistenza nella ricerca e alla traduzione linguistica1.


00:07:41.639 of how large language models work can be
00:07:43.599 split into three steps the first of
00:07:46.199 these steps is called tokenization and
00:07:48.520 there are neural networks that are
00:07:50.080 trained to split long text into
00:07:52.759 individual tokens and a token is
00:07:55.240 essentially about 34s of a word so if
00:07:58.080 it's a shorter word like high or that or
00:08:01.080 there it's probably just one token but
00:08:03.759 if you have a longer word like
00:08:05.319 summarization it's going to be split
00:08:07.159 into multiple pieces and the way that
00:08:09.400 tokenization happens is actually
00:08:11.080 different for every model some of them
00:08:12.879 separate prefixes and suffixes let's
00:08:15.080 look at an example what is the tallest
00:08:17.599 building so what is the tallest building
00:08:22.000 are all separate tokens and so that
00:08:24.280 separates the suffix off of tallest but
00:08:26.720 not building because it is taking the
00:08:28.440 context into account and this step is
00:08:30.800 done so models can understand each word
00:08:33.039 individually just like humans we
00:08:35.159 understand each word individually and as
00:08:37.640 groupings of words and then the second
00:08:39.799 step of llms is something called
00:08:41.599 embeddings the large language models
00:08:43.559 turns those tokens into embedding
00:08:45.680 vectors turning those tokens into
00:08:47.800 essentially a bunch of numerical
00:08:49.640 representations of those tokens numbers
00:08:52.480 and this makes it significantly easier
00:08:54.480 for the computer to read and understand
00:08:56.519 each word and how the different words

Come funzionano i grandi modelli di linguaggio? È una domanda affascinante! Cercherò di spiegarlo senza utilizzare termini tecnici o matematici complessi.

    Tokenizzazione: Questo è il primo passo. Immagina che i modelli di linguaggio abbiano bisogno di “spezzare” il testo in piccoli pezzi chiamati token. Un token può essere una singola parola o anche una parte di una parola più lunga. Ad esempio, la frase “What is the tallest building?” viene suddivisa in token come “What”, “is”, “the”, “tallest”, e “building”. Ogni token è trattato separatamente, proprio come noi umani comprendiamo le parole individualmente e insieme.

    Embedding: Ora, ogni token viene convertito in un vettore di embedding. Questo vettore è una serie di numeri che rappresentano il significato del token. Ad esempio, la parola “cat” potrebbe essere rappresentata come il vettore [0.0074, 0.0030, -0.0105, ...]. Questi numeri catturano le relazioni tra le parole e semplificano la lettura e la comprensione per il computer.

    Trasformatori: Infine, arriviamo ai trasformatori, che sono il cuore dei grandi modelli di linguaggio. I trasformatori sono come blocchi di costruzione fondamentali. Immagina di avere molti di questi blocchi, ognuno specializzato in un compito specifico. Quando fai una domanda al modello, seleziona il blocco più adatto per rispondere. Questo processo è ciò che rende i modelli di linguaggio così potenti e versatili.

In breve, i grandi modelli di linguaggio imparano dalle parole, le rappresentano come vettori e poi utilizzano i trasformatori per generare risposte intelligenti. È un mondo affascinante, e la ricerca continua a migliorare questi modelli giorno dopo giorno!

00:08:58.160 relate to each other and these numbers
00:09:00.120 all correspond with the position in an
00:09:02.720 embeddings Vector database and then the
00:09:04.880 final step in the process is
00:09:06.320 Transformers which we'll get to in a
00:09:08.320 little bit but first let's talk about
00:09:10.040 Vector databases and I'm going to use
00:09:11.920 the terms word and token interchangeably
00:09:14.399 so just keep that in mind because
00:09:15.920 they're almost the same thing not quite
00:09:17.760 but almost and so these word embeddings
00:09:20.320 that I've been talking about are placed
00:09:22.120 into something called a vector database
00:09:24.200 these databases are storage and
00:09:25.880 retrieval mechanisms that are highly
00:09:28.000 optimized for vectors and again those
00:09:30.320 are just numbers long series of numbers
00:09:32.760 because they're converted into these
00:09:34.360 vectors they can easily see which words
00:09:36.959 are related to other words based on how
00:09:39.440 similar they are how close they are
00:09:41.360 based on their embeddings and that is
00:09:43.680 how the large language model is able to
00:09:45.680 predict the next word based on the
00:09:47.360 previous words Vector databases capture
00:09:49.760 the relationship between data as vectors
00:09:52.519 in multidimensional space I know that
00:09:54.720 sounds complicated but it's really just
00:09:56.920 a lot of numbers vectors are objects
00:09:59.519 with a magnitude and a direction which

Come funzionano i grandi modelli di linguaggio?

I grandi modelli di linguaggio operano attraverso tre passaggi fondamentali. Cercherò di spiegarli senza utilizzare termini tecnici o matematici complessi:

        Ogni token è trattato separatamente, proprio come noi umani comprendiamo le parole individualmente e insieme.

    Embedding (Vettori):

        Questo vettore è una serie di numeri che rappresentano il significato del token.

00:10:01.920 both influence how similar one vector is
00:10:04.440 to another and that is how llms
00:10:06.600 represent words based on those numbers
00:10:08.800 each word gets turned into a vector
00:10:10.839 capturing semantic meaning and its
00:10:13.120 relationship to other words so here's an
00:10:15.320 example the words book and worm which
00:10:18.480 independently might not look like
00:10:20.200 they're related to each other but they
00:10:21.760 are related Concepts because they
00:10:23.640 frequently appear together a bookworm
00:10:26.120 somebody who likes to read a lot and
00:10:27.720 because of that they will have
00:10:29.160 embeddings that look close to each other
00:10:31.360 and so models build up an understanding
00:10:33.320 of natural language using these
00:10:34.920 embeddings and looking for similarity of
00:10:36.760 different words terms groupings of words
00:10:39.240 and all of these nuanced relationships
00:10:41.720 and the vector format helps models
00:10:43.880 understand natural language better than
00:10:45.440 other formats and you can kind of think
00:10:47.680 of all this like a map if you have a map
00:10:49.920 with two landmarks that are close to
00:10:51.560 each other they're likely going to have
00:10:53.279 very similar coordinates so it's kind of
00:10:55.760 like that okay now let's talk about

 entrambi influenzano quanto simile è un vettore a un altro, e questo è come gli LLMS rappresentano le parole basandosi su questi numeri. Ogni parola viene trasformata in un vettore, catturando il significato semantico e la sua relazione con altre parole. Ecco un esempio: le parole “libro” e “verme” potrebbero non sembrare correlate tra loro, ma in realtà sono concetti correlati perché spesso compaiono insieme. Un “bookworm” (lettore accanito) è qualcuno a cui piace leggere molto, e a causa di ciò avrà embedding (rappresentazioni vettoriali) che sono vicine tra loro. I modelli costruiscono una comprensione del linguaggio naturale utilizzando queste rappresentazioni vettoriali e cercando la somiglianza tra diverse parole, gruppi di parole e tutte queste relazioni sfumate. Il formato vettoriale aiuta i modelli a comprendere il linguaggio naturale meglio di altri formati. Puoi pensare a tutto ciò come a una mappa: se hai una mappa con due punti di riferimento vicini tra loro, avranno coordinate molto simili. È un po’ come quello. Ora parliamo delle trasformazioni e delle rappresentazioni matriciali.

00:10:57.800 Transformers mat Matrix representations
00:11:00.240 can be made out of those vectors that we
00:11:02.120 were just talking about this is done by
00:11:04.320 extracting some information out of the
00:11:06.600 numbers and placing all of the
00:11:08.399 information into a matrix through an
00:11:10.480 algorithm called multihead attention the
00:11:13.240 output of the multi-head attention
00:11:15.399 algorithm is a set of numbers which
00:11:17.480 tells the model how much the words and
00:11:20.079 its order are contributing to the
00:11:22.480 sentence as a whole we transform the
00:11:25.079 input Matrix into an output Matrix which
00:11:28.279 will then correspond with a word having
00:11:31.120 the same values as that output Matrix so
00:11:33.639 basically we're taking that input Matrix
00:11:35.720 converting it into an output Matrix and
00:11:38.120 then converting it into natural language
00:11:40.160 and the word is the final output of this
00:11:42.040 whole process this transformation is
00:11:44.560 done by the algorithm that was created
00:11:46.680 during the training process so the
00:11:48.760 model's understanding of how to do this
00:11:50.399 transformation is based on all of its
00:11:52.440 knowledge that it was trained with all
00:11:54.200 of that text Data from the internet from
00:11:56.200 books from articles Etc and it learned
00:11:58.200 which sequences of of words go together
00:12:00.120 and their corresponding next words based
00:12:02.240 on the weights determined during
00:12:04.160 training Transformers use an attention
00:12:06.480 mechanism to understand the context of
00:12:09.200 words within a sentence it involves

I Transformers e le rappresentazioni matriciali possono essere create a partire da quei vettori di cui stavamo appena parlando. Questo viene fatto estraendo alcune informazioni dai numeri e inserendole tutte in una matrice attraverso un algoritmo chiamato attenzione multihead. L’output dell’algoritmo di attenzione multihead è un insieme di numeri che indica al modello quanto le parole e il loro ordine contribuiscano alla frase nel suo complesso. Trasformiamo la matrice di input in una matrice di output, che corrisponderà poi a una parola con gli stessi valori di quella matrice di output. In sostanza, stiamo prendendo quella matrice di input, la stiamo convertendo in una matrice di output e poi la stiamo trasformando in linguaggio naturale, e la parola è l’output finale di tutto questo processo. Questa trasformazione è eseguita dall’algoritmo creato durante il processo di addestramento. La comprensione del modello su come effettuare questa trasformazione si basa su tutte le sue conoscenze acquisite durante l’addestramento, utilizzando tutti i dati testuali provenienti da Internet, libri, articoli, ecc. Il modello ha imparato quali sequenze di parole vanno insieme e le relative parole successive in base ai pesi determinati durante l’addestramento. I Transformer utilizzano un meccanismo di attenzione per comprendere il contesto delle parole all’interno di una frase. Questo coinvolge calcoli con il prodotto scalare, che essenzialmente rappresenta quanto la parola abbia contribuito alla frase. Verrà calcolata la differenza tra i prodotti scalari delle parole e verrà assegnato un valore corrispondente.


00:12:11.519 calculations with the dot product which
00:12:13.760 is essentially a number representing how
00:12:15.839 much the word contributed to the
00:12:17.760 sentence it will find the difference
00:12:19.839 between the dot products of words and
00:12:21.959 give it correspondingly large values for
00:12:24.320 attention and it will take that word
00:12:26.160 into account more if it has higher
00:12:28.160 attention now now let's talk about how
00:12:29.839 large language models actually get
00:12:31.519 trained the first step of training a
00:12:33.839 large language model is collecting the
00:12:35.920 data you need a lot of data when I say
00:12:38.560 billions of parameters that is just a
00:12:41.160 measure of how much data is actually
00:12:43.480 going into training these models and you
00:12:45.360 need to find a really good data set if
00:12:47.199 you have really bad data going into a
00:12:49.519 model then you're going to have a really
00:12:51.120 bad model garbage in garbage out so if a
00:12:54.040 data set is incomplete or biased the
00:12:56.399 large language model will be also and
00:12:58.480 data sets are huge we're talking about
00:13:01.240 massive massive amounts of data they
00:13:03.440 take data in from web pages from books
00:13:06.160 from conversations from Reddit posts
00:13:08.880 from xposts from YouTube transcriptions
00:13:12.000 basically anywhere where we can get some
00:13:14.040 Text data that data is becoming so
00:13:16.639 valuable let me put into context how


I calcoli con il prodotto scalare rappresentano essenzialmente un numero che indica quanto una parola abbia contribuito alla frase. Verrà calcolata la differenza tra i prodotti scalari delle parole e verrà assegnato un valore corrispondente. Se il prodotto scalare è maggiore, la parola verrà presa in considerazione in modo più rilevante. Ora parliamo di come i grandi modelli di linguaggio vengono effettivamente addestrati. Il primo passo per addestrare un grande modello di linguaggio è raccogliere i dati. Hai bisogno di molte informazioni; quando dico “miliardi di parametri”, mi riferisco a quanto dati vengano effettivamente utilizzati per addestrare questi modelli. Devi trovare un set di dati di alta qualità. Se hai dati di scarsa qualità, otterrai un modello altrettanto scadente. Quindi, se un set di dati è incompleto o distorto, anche il grande modello di linguaggio lo sarà. I set di dati sono enormi, stiamo parlando di quantità massicce di dati. Prendono dati da pagine web, libri, conversazioni, post su Reddit, trascrizioni di YouTube e praticamente ovunque si possa ottenere del testo. Questi dati stanno diventando sempre più preziosi. Per mettere in prospettiva quanto siano enormi i set di dati, ecco un piccolo frammento di testo composto da 276 token. Ora, se ingrandiamo, un singolo pixel rappresenta tanti token. Ecco una rappresentazione di 285 milioni di token, che corrisponde allo 0,02% dei 1,3 trilioni di token che alcuni grandi modelli di linguaggio utilizzano per l’addestramento.


00:13:19.040 massive the data sets we're talking
00:13:20.600 about really are so here's a little bit
00:13:22.399 of text which is 276 tokens that's it
00:13:25.959 now if we zoom out that one pixel is
00:13:28.600 that many tokens and now here's a
00:13:30.680 representation of 285 million tokens
00:13:34.040 which is
00:13:35.040 0.02% of the 1.3 trillion tokens that
00:13:38.240 some large language models take to train
00:13:40.399 and there's an entire science behind
00:13:42.519 data pre-processing which prepares the
00:13:44.839 data to be used to train a model
00:13:47.120 everything from looking at the data
00:13:48.639 quality to labeling consistency data
00:13:51.519 cleaning data transformation and data
00:13:54.240 reduction but I'm not going to go too
00:13:55.920 deep into that and this pre-processing
00:13:58.440 can take a long time and it depends on
00:14:00.600 the type of machine being used how much
00:14:02.399 processing power you have the size of
00:14:04.320 the data set the number of
00:14:05.920 pre-processing steps and a whole bunch
00:14:08.199 of other factors that make it really
00:14:10.279 difficult to know exactly how long
00:14:11.600 pre-processing is going to take but one
00:14:13.480 thing that we know takes a long time is
00:14:15.560 the actual training companies like
00:14:17.720 Nvidia are building Hardware
00:14:19.600 specifically tailored for the math
00:14:21.480 behind large language models and this
00:14:23.759 Hardware is constantly getting better
00:14:25.720 the software used to process these
00:14:27.240 models are getting better also and so
00:14:29.199 the total time to process models is
00:14:31.320 decreasing but the size of the models is

I set di dati massicci di cui stiamo parlando sono davvero enormi. Ecco un piccolo frammento di testo composto da 276 token. Ora, se ingrandiamo, un singolo pixel rappresenta tanti token. Ecco una rappresentazione di 285 milioni di token, che corrisponde allo 0,02% dei 1,3 trilioni di token che alcuni grandi modelli di linguaggio utilizzano per l’addestramento. Dietro la pre-elaborazione dei dati c’è tutta una scienza che prepara i dati per essere utilizzati nell’addestramento di un modello. Questo processo include tutto, dalla valutazione della qualità dei dati alla coerenza delle etichette, dalla pulizia dei dati alla trasformazione e riduzione dei dati. Non entrerò troppo nei dettagli, ma la pre-elaborazione può richiedere molto tempo e dipende dal tipo di macchina utilizzata, dalla potenza di elaborazione a disposizione, dalle dimensioni del set di dati, dal numero di passaggi di pre-elaborazione e da molti altri fattori che rendono difficile stimare esattamente quanto tempo richiederà. Tuttavia, sappiamo che l’addestramento vero e proprio richiede molto tempo. Aziende come Nvidia stanno costruendo hardware appositamente progettato per la matematica alla base dei grandi modelli di linguaggio, e questo hardware sta migliorando costantemente. Anche il software utilizzato per elaborare questi modelli sta migliorando. Quindi, sebbene il tempo totale per elaborare i modelli stia diminuendo, le dimensioni dei modelli stanno aumentando. Addestrare questi modelli è estremamente costoso perché richiede molta potenza di elaborazione ed elettricità.


00:14:33.279 increasing and to train these models it
00:14:35.399 is extremely expensive because you need
00:14:37.959 a lot of processing power electricity
00:14:40.560 and these chips are not cheap and that
00:14:43.000 is why Nvidia stock price has
00:14:44.759 skyrocketed their revenue growth has
00:14:46.959 been extraordinary and so with the
00:14:49.360 process of training we take this
00:14:50.800 pre-processed text data that we talked
00:14:53.040 about earlier and it's fed into the
00:14:54.959 model and then using Transformers or
00:14:57.240 whatever technology a model is actually
00:14:59.480 based on but most likely Transformers it
00:15:02.000 will try to predict the next word based
00:15:04.680 on the context of that data and it's
00:15:06.639 going to adjust the weights of the model
00:15:09.120 to get the best possible output and this
00:15:12.120 process repeats millions and millions of
00:15:14.880 times over and over again until we reach
00:15:16.959 some optimal quality and then the final
00:15:19.240 step is evaluation a small amount of the
00:15:21.440 data is set aside for evaluation and the
00:15:23.839 model is tested on this data set for
00:15:26.959 performance and then the model is is
00:15:28.800 adjusted if necessary the metric used to
00:15:31.560 determine the effectiveness of the model
00:15:33.720 is called perplexity it will compare two
00:15:36.199 words based on their similarity and it
00:15:38.199 will give a good score if the words are
00:15:40.319 related and a bad score if it's not and


L’addestramento di questi modelli è estremamente costoso perché richiede molta potenza di elaborazione ed elettricità. Le chip necessarie per questo scopo non sono economiche, ed è per questo che il prezzo delle azioni di Nvidia è schizzato alle stelle e la crescita dei loro ricavi è stata straordinaria. Nel processo di addestramento, prendiamo i dati di testo pre-elaborati di cui abbiamo parlato in precedenza e li alimentiamo al modello. Utilizzando i Transformer o qualsiasi altra tecnologia su cui si basa effettivamente il modello (ma molto probabilmente i Transformer), il modello cercherà di prevedere la parola successiva in base al contesto di quei dati. Regolerà i pesi del modello per ottenere l’output migliore possibile. Questo processo si ripete milioni e milioni di volte, fino a raggiungere una qualità ottimale. La fase finale è l’valutazione: una piccola quantità di dati viene riservata per la valutazione, e il modello viene testato su questo set


00:15:42.680 then we also use rlf reinforcement
00:15:45.959 learning through human feedback and
00:15:47.880 that's when users or testers actually
00:15:50.120 test the model and provide positive or
00:15:52.440 negative scores based on the output and
00:15:54.560 then once again the model is adjusted as
00:15:57.040 necessary all right let's talk about
00:15:58.880 fine-tuning now which I think a lot of
00:16:00.920 you are going to be interested in
00:16:02.160 because it's something that the average
00:16:03.920 person can get into quite easily so we
00:16:06.560 have these popular large language models
00:16:08.720 that are trained on massive sets of data
00:16:11.079 to build general language capabilities
00:16:13.800 and these pre-trained models like Bert
00:16:16.199 like GPT give developers a head start
00:16:18.680 versus training models from scratch but
00:16:20.920 then in comes fine-tuning which allows
00:16:23.440 us to take these raw models these
00:16:25.759 Foundation models and fine-tune them for
00:16:28.079 our specific specific use cases so let's
00:16:30.079 think about an example let's say you
00:16:31.480 want to fine tuna model to be able to
00:16:33.759 take pizza orders to be able to have
00:16:35.639 conversations answer questions about
00:16:37.319 pizza and finally be able to allow
00:16:40.000 customers to buy pizza you can take a
00:16:42.360 pre-existing set of conversations that
00:16:45.040 exemplify the back and forth between a
00:16:47.279 pizza shop and a customer load that in
00:16:49.680 fine- tune a model and then all of a
00:16:51.399 sudden that model is going to be much
00:16:53.120 better at having conversations about
00:16:55.399 pizza ordering the model updates the
00:16:57.440 weights to be better at understanding
00:16:59.560 certain Pizza terminology questions
00:17:02.120 responses tone everything and
00:17:04.559 fine-tuning is much faster than a full
00:17:07.039 training and it produces much higher
00:17:09.240 accuracy and fine-tuning allows
00:17:11.359 pre-trained models to be fine-tuned for
00:17:13.480 real world use cases and finally you can
00:17:16.240 take a single foundational model and
00:17:18.359 fine-tune it any number of times for any
00:17:21.319 number of use cases and there are a lot
00:17:23.760 of great Services out there that allow
00:17:25.599 you to do that and again it's all about
00:17:27.880 the quality of your data so if you have
00:17:29.840 a really good data set that you're going
00:17:31.160 to f- tune a model on the model is going
00:17:33.000 to be really really good and conversely
00:17:35.440 if you have a poor quality data set it's
00:17:37.760 not going to perform as well all right
00:17:39.799 let me pause for a second and talk about
00:17:41.360 AI Camp so as mentioned earlier this
00:17:44.080 video all of its content the animations
00:17:46.760 have been created in collaboration with
00:17:48.799 students from AI Camp AI Camp is a
00:17:51.080 learning experience for students that
00:17:52.600 are aged 13 and above you work in small
00:17:55.559 personalized groups with experienced
00:17:57.880 mentors you work together to create an
00:18:00.280 AI product using NLP computer vision and
00:18:03.720 data science AI Camp has both a 3-week
00:18:06.520 and a onewe program during summer that
00:18:09.039 requires zero programming experience and
00:18:11.919 they also have a new program which is 10
00:18:13.840 weeks long during the school year which
00:18:15.799 is less intensive than the onewe and
00:18:17.720 3-we programs for those students who are
00:18:19.559 really busy AI Camp's mission is to
00:18:22.000 provide students with deep knowledge and
00:18:24.640 artificial intelligence which will
00:18:26.280 position them to be ready for a in the
00:18:29.120 real world I'll link an article from USA
00:18:31.440 Today in the description all about AI
00:18:33.480 camp but if you're a student or if
00:18:35.159 you're a parent of a student within this
00:18:37.000 age I would highly recommend checking
00:18:38.919 out AI Camp go to ai- camp.org to learn
00:18:43.039 more now let's talk about limitations
00:18:45.280 and challenges of large language models
00:18:47.480 as capable as llms are they still have a
00:18:50.400 lot of limitations recent models
00:18:52.440 continue to get better but they are
00:18:53.840 still flawed they're incredibly valuable
00:18:56.120 and knowledgeable in certain ways but
00:18:58.120 they're also deeply flawed in others
00:18:59.960 like math and logic and reasoning they
00:19:02.280 still struggle a lot of the time versus
00:19:04.520 humans which understand Concepts like
00:19:06.679 that pretty easily also bias and safety
00:19:09.880 continue to be a big problem large
00:19:11.760 language models are trained on data
00:19:13.880 created by humans which is naturally
00:19:16.039 flawed humans have opinions on
00:19:18.559 everything and those opinions trickle
00:19:20.559 down into these models these data sets
00:19:23.039 may include harmful or biased
00:19:25.080 information and some companies take
00:19:26.919 their models a step further and provide
00:19:29.039 a level of censorship to those models
00:19:31.400 and that's an entire discussion in
00:19:32.919 itself whether censorship is worthwhile
00:19:35.080 or not I know a lot of you already know
00:19:36.799 my opinions on this from my previous
00:19:38.440 videos and another big limitation of
00:19:40.360 llms historically has been that they
00:19:42.960 only have knowledge up into the point
00:19:44.840 where their training occurred but that
00:19:46.760 is starting to be solved with chat GPT
00:19:49.080 being able to browse the web for example
00:19:51.080 Gro from x. aai being able to access
00:19:53.919 live tweets but there's still a lot of
00:19:55.799 Kinks to be worked out with this also
00:19:57.960 another another big challenge for large
00:19:59.520 language modelss is hallucinations which
00:20:01.760 means that they sometimes just make
00:20:03.480 things up or get things patently wrong
00:20:06.200 and they will be so confident in being
00:20:08.520 wrong too they will state things with
00:20:10.640 the utmost confidence but will be
00:20:12.799 completely wrong look at this example
00:20:15.320 how many letters are in the string and
00:20:17.080 then we give it a random string of
00:20:18.640 characters and then the answer is the
00:20:21.440 string has 16 letters even though it
00:20:23.440 only has 15 letters another problem is
00:20:26.240 that large language models are EXT
00:20:28.200 extremely Hardware intensive they cost a
00:20:31.360 ton to train and to fine-tune because it
00:20:34.640 takes so much processing power to do
00:20:36.919 that and there's a lot of Ethics to
00:20:39.080 consider too a lot of AI companies say
00:20:41.840 they aren't training their models on
00:20:43.440 copyrighted material but that has been
00:20:45.360 found to be false currently there are a
00:20:48.080 ton of lawsuits going through the courts
00:20:50.799 about this issue next let's talk about
00:20:52.880 the real world applications of large
00:20:54.799 language models why are they so valuable
00:20:57.039 why are they so talked about about and
00:20:58.640 why are they transforming the world
00:21:00.720 right in front of our eyes large
00:21:02.240 language models can be used for a wide
00:21:04.559 variety of tasks not just chatbots they
00:21:07.760 can be used for language translation
00:21:09.480 they can be used for coding they can be
00:21:11.320 used as programming assistants they can
00:21:13.520 be used for summarization question
00:21:15.360 answering essay writing translation and
00:21:18.159 even image and video creation basically
00:21:20.640 any type of thought problem that a human
00:21:22.600 can do with a computer large language
00:21:24.840 models can likely also do if not today
00:21:28.120 pretty soon in the future now let's talk
00:21:30.000 about current advancements and research
00:21:32.080 currently there's a lot of talk about
00:21:33.559 knowledge distillation which basically
00:21:35.400 means transferring key Knowledge from
00:21:37.440 very large Cutting Edge models to
00:21:39.640 smaller more efficient models think
00:21:41.679 about it like a professor condensing
00:21:43.679 Decades of experience in a textbook down
00:21:46.080 to something that the students can
00:21:48.080 comprehend and this allows smaller
00:21:50.080 language models to benefit from the
00:21:51.880 knowledge gained from these large
00:21:53.279 language models but still run highly
00:21:55.360 efficiently on everyday consumer
00:21:57.360 hardware and and it makes large language
00:21:59.080 models more accessible and practical to
00:22:01.200 run even on cell phones or other end
00:22:04.279 devices there's also been a lot of
00:22:06.000 research and emphasis on rag which is
00:22:08.279 retrieval augmented generation which
00:22:10.440 basically means you're giving large
00:22:12.039 language models the ability to look up
00:22:14.080 information outside of the data that it
00:22:16.559 was trained on you're using Vector
00:22:18.400 databases the same way that large
00:22:20.520 language models are trained but you're
00:22:22.159 able to store massive amounts of
00:22:24.360 additional data that can be queried by
00:22:26.440 that large language model now let's talk
00:22:28.320 about the ethical considerations and
00:22:30.159 there's a lot to think about here and
00:22:31.960 I'm just touching on some of the major
00:22:34.000 topics first we already talked about
00:22:36.000 that the models are trained on
00:22:37.520 potentially copyrighted material and if
00:22:39.600 that's the case is that fair use
00:22:41.760 probably not next these models can and
00:22:45.039 will be used for harmful acts there's no
00:22:47.760 avoiding it large language models can be
00:22:49.919 used to scam other people to create
00:22:52.120 massive misinformation and
00:22:53.640 disinformation campaigns including fake
00:22:56.320 images fake text fake opinions and
00:22:59.200 almost definitely the entire White
00:23:01.000 Collar Workforce is going to be
00:23:02.679 disrupted by large language models as I
00:23:05.400 mentioned anything anybody can do in
00:23:07.480 front of a computer is probably
00:23:09.360 something that the AI can also do so
00:23:11.799 lawyers writers programmers there are so
00:23:14.799 many different professions that are
00:23:16.080 going to be completely disrupted by
00:23:18.080 artificial intelligence and then finally
00:23:20.640 AGI what happens when AI becomes so
00:23:24.039 smart and maybe even starts thinking for
00:23:26.360 itself this is where we have to have
00:23:28.400 something called alignment which means
00:23:30.200 the AI is aligned to the same incentives
00:23:32.720 and outcomes as humans so last let's
00:23:35.360 talk about what's happening on The
00:23:36.440 Cutting Edge and in the immediate future
00:23:38.640 there are a number of ways large
00:23:40.120 language models can be improved first
00:23:42.279 they can fact check themselves with
00:23:44.080 information gathered from the web but
00:23:45.919 obviously you can see the inherent flaws
00:23:47.760 in that then we also touched on mixture
00:23:50.240 of experts which is an incredible new
00:23:53.120 technology which allows multiple models
00:23:55.400 to kind of be merged together all fine
00:23:57.520 tune to be experts in certain domains
00:24:00.159 and then when the actual prompt comes
00:24:02.400 through it chooses which of those
00:24:04.400 experts to use so these are huge models
00:24:06.600 that actually run really really
00:24:08.640 efficiently and then there's a lot of
00:24:10.440 work on multimodality so taking input
00:24:12.760 from voice from images from video every
00:24:15.640 possible input source and having a
00:24:17.679 single output from that there's also a
00:24:19.720 lot of work being done to improve
00:24:21.480 reasoning ability having models think
00:24:23.960 slowly is a new trend that I've been
00:24:26.279 seeing in papers like orca too which
00:24:28.440 basically just forces a large language
00:24:30.559 model to think about problems step by
00:24:32.679 step rather than trying to jump to the
00:24:34.880 final conclusion immediately and then
00:24:37.279 also larger context sizes if you want a
00:24:40.159 large language model to process a huge
00:24:42.120 amount of data it has to have a very
00:24:44.039 large context window and a context
00:24:46.159 window is just how much information you
00:24:47.919 can give to a prompt to get the output
00:24:51.000 and one way to achieve that is by giving
00:24:53.240 large language models memory with
00:24:55.000 projects like mgpt which I did a video
00:24:57.960 on and I'll drop that in the description
00:24:59.640 below and that just means giving models
00:25:01.840 external memory from that core data set

What are Large Language Models (LLMs)? (00:00 - 09:59)

LLMs stand for large language models, which are a type of neural network trained on massive amounts of text data.


Trained on various text sources such as web scraping, books, and transcripts.

Neural network is a series of algorithms simulating the human brain, while LLMs focus on understanding natural language.

LLMs vs. Traditional Programming

Traditional programming is instruction-based, while LLMs focus on teaching the computer how to learn rather than what to do.


LLMs are more flexible and adaptable, suitable for applications where traditional coding falls short.

History and Evolution of LLMs

Traces back to the Eliza model in 1966, the first language model with pre-programmed answers based on keywords.


Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were created in 1924 but only gained learning capabilities in 1972.

In 2017, the Google Deep Mind team introduced the Transformers architecture, revolutionizing large language models.

Large Language Models Development

GPT-1, developed by OpenAI in 2018, had 117 million parameters.


BERT, released in 2018, had 340 million parameters and bidirectionality for better context understanding.

GPT-2, with 2.5 billion parameters, was released in early 2019, followed by GPT-3 in June 2020 with 175 billion parameters.


GPT-4, released in March 2023, boasted 1.76 trillion parameters and utilized a mixture of experts approach.

How LLMs Work

Tokenization is the first step, where neural networks split long text into individual tokens, about 3-4 characters of a word.


Tokenization varies for each model, separating prefixes and suffixes based on context.

The second step involves turning tokens into embedding vectors, representing them numerically for easier computer processing.


These embeddings are placed into a vector database, allowing the model to predict the next word based on the previous words.

Transformers, a final step in the process, play a crucial role in the functionality of LLMs.

Word Embeddings and Vectors (10:01 - 20:01)

Words are represented as vectors capturing semantic meaning and their relationships to other words.


Example: "book" and "worm" are related concepts because they frequently appear together as "bookworm."

Models build an understanding of natural language using these embeddings to look for similarity and nuanced relationships.

Vector format helps models understand natural language better than other formats.

Transformers and Matrix Representations

Vectors are used to create matrix representations through multihead attention algorithm.


The algorithm extracts information from the numbers and places it into a matrix.

Transformers use an attention mechanism to understand the context of words within a sentence.

Training Large Language Models

Large language models require collecting massive amounts of data from various sources like web pages, books, conversations, etc.

Data preprocessing involves ensuring data quality, labeling consistency, cleaning, transformation, and reduction.

Training requires significant processing power, specialized hardware, and is extremely expensive.

The training process involves repeatedly predicting the next word based on context and adjusting the model's weights.


Evaluation is done using a metric called perplexity and reinforcement learning through human feedback.

What is a large language model? (00:00 - 05:22)

A large language model is an instance of a foundation model, pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled and self-supervised data.


Learns from patterns in data to produce generalizable and adaptable output.

Trained specifically on text and text-like things, such as code.


Trained on large datasets of text, potentially petabytes in size.

GPT-3, for example, is pre-trained on a corpus of 45 terabytes of data and uses 175 billion ML parameters.


---
How do large language models work?

LLMs consist of three main components: data, architecture, and training.


Data involves enormous amounts of text data.

Architecture is based on a transformer neural network designed to understand the context of words within sentences.

During training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence and gradually improves its word predictions until it can reliably generate coherent sentences.

The model can be fine-tuned on a smaller, more specific dataset to become an expert at a specific task.
